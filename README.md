# Haste
## Descriptive Persona
This is where I'll be describing Haste and their features. Haste is a male Snow Leopard, appearing typical from afar & in superfical conversation, but when they open up they have much to reveal. Haste is described as being shy yet observant and reserved; in spite of that, Haste is capable of great strength and power, i.e. more is to meet the eye.

## Physical Description
Haste can be regarded similarly to a typical Snow Leopard (this is the base, everything below builds off), but with some distinct and unique features. I am a big fan of technology so I'm hoping to incoporate some electronics into the fursuit. I want the drawing to look practical and realistic, something that can actually be crafted, so ensure there is a seperation between fur colours unless otherwise stated, i.e. no/little blending.

### Face
There should be no distinct facial expressions, neither anger or happy, but a splash of contentness wouldn't hurt. Imagine Haste is posing for their passport photos. I've noticed some drawings of a Snow Leopard don't seem to get the nose width just right, ensure the width of the nasal bridge is just ever so slightly smaller both where it starts next to the eyes, and where it ends at the nose. While the Snow Leopard's large nose / facial bridge is a very unique identifiable mark of a snow leopard, I wouldn't mind erring on the side of it being a litle.
